### Application under test
[Restful booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/) - An API playground created by [Mark Winteringham](https://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/) for those wanting to learn more about API testing and tools.

### ðŸ”¢ Requiring (one time) manual setup by user

1. [**JDK 11**](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) - as language of choice
   for writing this test framework.
2. [**Maven 3.8.6+**](https://maven.apache.org/) - for project dependency management and running tests in CI.
3. [**git-crypt**](docs/README-GIT-CRYPT.md) - to encrypt/decrypt secret files.
4. [**pre-commit**](docs/README-CODE-FORMATTING.md) - To have code automatically and uniformly formatted (JAVA, JSON,
   XML, YAML).

## ðŸš€ Core features

- [x] Allow to put both exploratory tests (postman style http requests) and automated tests (RestAssured) side-by-side
  in the same framework. Usually due to Postman not being git compatible, these two tests live in two separate
  places/repositories.
- [x] Shows how to create a decoupled test design (that minimises maintenance efforts by reducing code
  duplication and increases code readability by separating test intentions from implementation details).
- [x] Allows users to write fluent assertions for asserting both status and response body, without any code duplication.
- [x] Creates APIs that are scope/role agnostic. This allows you to use the same APIs and data to write tests for
  different user roles and scopes.
- [x] Shows how to provide different token types for different role/scopes using a TokenFactory pattern.
- [x] Shows how to reuse the same auth token in all the tests for same role/scope using a Singleton pattern.
- [ ] Shows how to use health checks in the test CI to have efficient pipelines.
- [ ] Shows how to insert test data dynamically in each test.

> A Note on Postman style (HTTP Request) tests from AQUA:
> - These tests are git compatible (unlike Postman that requires you to take a paid
    membership for properly version controlling its collections). In these HTTP request tests:
> - User can define different environments (such as localhost, develop, staging). For each environment, user can
    specify env specific configuration such as hostURLs.
> - Provides a way to separate secret information (such as userid/password) from other generic config information.
> - Provides a way to run pre-request and post-request scripts that can be used to set variables such as auth-tokens.
> - Until AQUA IDE is closedThese auth-tokens/variables are then available to any other http request that needs to use
    these tokens/variables.
> - Provides a way to run post-request scripts that can be used to set variables, log values and write some basic tests.

## ðŸŽ¯ Standard features

> From RestAssured testing and [Core test framework: zero](https://github.com/PramodKumarYadav/zero) are as below:

- [ ] Shows how to integrate your tests in CI (GitHub Actions).
- [ ] Shows how to log your test results into a test monitoring system (such as Elastic/Kibana or DataDog)
- [x] Shows how to do JSON Schema validation.
- [x] Shows how to separate config from code.
- [x] Shows how to deal with Secrets in local and in CI. Also on how to skip logging secret information on console.
- [ ] More to be added...
